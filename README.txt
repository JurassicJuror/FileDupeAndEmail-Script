Welcome to my simple script!

The objective of this script is to take a master file, duplicate it, amend the current date to the filename and email it.

This can be assigned to a scheduled task in Windows to run at specific times/days.

To use this simply open the .bat and .ps1 files in your favourite IDE and change the values in square brackets to the value/data that is described (make sure you remove the square brackets before running the code).

If you wish to keep the created file instead of deleting it after sending, in the .bat file remove the DEL command.

Thank you for using my script, and enjoy!
